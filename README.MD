# Udacity Capstone - Travel App

This is the Capstone project for the Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree

## Description

The website allows the user to enter a city and a date, calling relevant APIs and changing the background image and weather information on the screen.

### APIs used:

- [Geonames API](http://www.geonames.org/export/web-services.html)
- [Weatherbit API](https://www.weatherbit.io/account/create)
- [Pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/)

### Additional Sources

## Additional tasks from the 'Make your project stand out section'

- Added icons from the Weatherbit API to the forecast
- Added image backup - if no image of the city entered is available, it will look for the image of the country
